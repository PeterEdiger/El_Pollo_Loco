# Class

```javascript
// class is a template for an object. 

class Contact {
    firstName;
    lastName;
}


```

# Inheritance

Problem: There could be properties and Methods that can be used in several classes. 

Solution: Write a class with this properties. Now every class can **inherit** this class. 



The class that can be used in several classes --> **parent class**

```javascript
// Syntax
// class Child gets extended by the parent. 
class Child extends Parent
```
